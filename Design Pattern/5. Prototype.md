# Intention
**Prototype** is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
# Problems
How you can copy an object => just iterate all field and copy them to new object. But sometime you cannot access all fields of an object like private field. 
# Solution
Prototype is delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned.
