# AWS Outposts

- **Hybrid Cloud:** businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
- Therefore, 2 ways of dealing with IT systems:
    - One for AWS cloud (using AWS console, CLI and AWS APIs)
    - One for their on-premises infrastructure
- **AWS Outposts are “server racks”** that offer the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tool to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
- **AWS will setup and manage “Outposts Rack”** within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
- You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security
