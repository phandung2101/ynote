# VPC Section Sumary

- CIDR - IP Range
- VPC - Virtual Private Cloud ⇒ we define a list of IPv4 & IPv6 CIDR
- Subnets - tied to an AZ, we define a CIDR
- Internet Gateway - at the VPC levle, provide IPv4 & IPv6 Internet Access
- Route Tables - must be edited to add routes from subnets to the IGW, VPC Peering Connections, VPC Endpoints, …
- Bastion Host - public EC2 instance to SSH into, that has SSH connectivity to EC2 instances in private subnets
- NAT Instances - gives Internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets. Old, must be setup in public subnet, disable Source/Destination check flag
- NAT Gateway - managed by AWS, provides scaleable Internet access to private EC2 instances, when the target is an IPv4 address
- NACL - stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound, don’t forget Ephemeral Ports
- Security Groups - stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level
- VPC Peering - connect 2 VPCs with non overlapping CIDR, non-transitive
- VPC Endpoints - provide private access to AWS Service (S3, DynamoDB, CF, SSM) within a VPC
- VPC Flow Logs - can be setup at the VPC/Subnet/ENI Level, for ACCEPT and REJECT traffic, helps identifying attacks, analyze using Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights
- Site-to-Site VPN - setup a Customer Gateway on DC, a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and site-to-site VPN over public Internet
- AWS VPN CloudHub - hub-and-spoke VPN model to connect to your sites
- Direct Connect - setup a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and establish a direct private connection to an AWS Direct Connect Location
- Direct Connect Gateway - setup a Direct Connect to many VPCs in different AWS Regions
- AWS PrivateLink/VPC Endpoint Services:
    - Connect services privately from your service VPC to customers VPC
    - Doesn’t need VPC Peering, public Internet, NAT Gateway, Route Tables
    - Must be used with Network Load Balancer & ENI
- ClassicLink - connect EC2-Classic EC2 instances privately to your VPC
- Transit Gateway - transitive peering connections for VPC, VPN & DX
- Traffic Mirroring - copy network traffic from ENIs for further analysis
- Egress-only Internet Gateway - like a NAT Gateway, but for IPv6
