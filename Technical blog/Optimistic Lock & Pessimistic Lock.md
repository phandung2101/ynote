Concurrency control in databases uses **optimistic locking** and **pessimistic locking** to manage data access and ensure consistency. Hereâ€™s a clear breakdown:
# Optimistic Locking
- Assumes conflicts are rare.
- Allows multiple transactions to read/write simultaneously.
- Checks for data changes before updating (e.g., version number/timestamp).
- Rolls back and retries if conflicts occur.
- Best for read-heavy, low-conflict systems.
- Pros: Lightweight, high concurrency.
- Cons: Requires retry logic.
# Pessimistic Locking
- Assumes conflicts are likely.
- Locks data during a transaction, blocking other reads/writes.
- Releases lock after transaction completes.
- Best for write-heavy, high-conflict systems.
- Pros: Ensures data safety.
- Cons: Can cause performance bottlenecks.
# Key Difference
- Optimistic: Prioritizes performance, risks conflicts.
- Pessimistic: Prioritizes safety, reduces concurrency.
# Problems with Optimistic Locking
Optimistic locking, while efficient for low-conflict scenarios, has several potential issues:
- **Conflict Resolution Overhead**: If conflicts occur, transactions must roll back and retry, increasing processing time and complexity, especially in high-contention environments.
- **Retry Logic Complexity**: Applications need robust retry mechanisms to handle failed updates, which can complicate code and error handling.
- **Performance in High-Conflict Scenarios**: Frequent conflicts lead to repeated retries, degrading performance compared to pessimistic locking.
- **Data Staleness**: Users may work with outdated data, only discovering conflicts at commit time, potentially causing user frustration or data loss.
- **Scalability Limits**: In systems with many concurrent updates, the likelihood of conflicts grows, making optimistic locking less effective.
