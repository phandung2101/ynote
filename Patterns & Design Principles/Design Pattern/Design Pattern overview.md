# What's a design pattern
- typical solutions to common occurring problems in software design
- pre-made blueprints
- not specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problems
- more high level description of a solution
# What does the pattern consist of?
- **Intent** describes both the problem and the solution
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible
- **Structure** of classes show each part of the pattern and how they are related
- **Code example** is example to make it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern
# Classification of pattern
- **Creational patterns** - object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code
- **Structural patterns** - how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient
- **Behavioral patterns** - take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
