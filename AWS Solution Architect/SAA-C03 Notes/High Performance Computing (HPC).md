# High Performance Computing (HPC)

- The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC
- You can create a very high number of resources in no time
- You can speed up time to results by adding more resources
- You can pay only for the systems you have used
- Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving

# Data Management & Transfer

- AWS Direct Connect (DX)
    - Over GB/s data to cloud over private secure network
- Snowball & Snowmobile
    - Move PB of data to the cloud
- AWS DataSync
    - Move large amount of data between on-premise and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows

# Compute and Networking

- EC2 Instances:
    - CPU optimized, GPU optimized
    - Spot Instances / Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling
- EC2 Placement Groups: **Cluster** for good network performance
    - Same rack same AZ â†’ low latency network
- EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV)
    - Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency
    - Option 1: **Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)** up to 100Gbps
    - Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10Gpbs - LEGACY
- **Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)**
    - Improved ENA for **HPC**, only works for Linux
    - Greate for inter-node communications, **tightly coupled workloads**
    - Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
    - Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport

# Storage

- Instance-attached storage:
    - EBS: scale up to 256,000 IOPS with io2 Block Express
    - Instance Store: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency
- Network storage:
    - Amazon S3: large blob, not a file system
    - Amazon EFS: scale IOPS based on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
    - Amazon FSx for Lustre:
        - HPC optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS
        - Backed by S3

# Automation and Orchestration

- AWS Batch
    - AWS Batch supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enables you to run signle jobs that span multiple EC2 instances
    - Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly
- AWS ParallelCluster
    - Open-source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
    - Configure with text files
    - Automate creation of VPC, Subnet, cluster type and instance types
    - **Ability to enable EFA on the cluster (improves network performance)**
